# Vifm Config

My configuration for the [vifm](https://wiki.vifm.info/index.php/Main_Page) file manager.

## Setup

- Make sure you have latest vifm version.
- Clone this repository.
- In `~/`, create a symbolic link pointing to the directory of this repository called `~/.vifm/` (you might have to backup and remove the `~/.vifm/` that is already there).
